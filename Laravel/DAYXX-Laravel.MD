# Laravel Introduction 08/xx/2023

## What is Laravel?
Laravel is an open-source PHP web framework known for its elegance and versatility. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, making web development efficient and enjoyable. Some key features include:

- **Eloquent ORM**: A powerful database query builder and ActiveRecord implementation.

- **Artisan CLI**: A command-line tool for automating common development tasks.

- **Blade Templating**: A clean and expressive template engine.

- **Routing**: Easily define routes and URLs for your application.

- **Middleware**: Add layers of functionality to HTTP requests.

- **Authentication**: Built-in user authentication and authorization systems.

- **Composer Integration**: Dependency management for libraries and packages.

- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing support with PHPUnit.

## Getting Started

### Installation

You can install Laravel Using Composer

   ```powershell
   composer global require laravel/installer
   laravel new project-name
   ```

### Folder Structure

Laravel follows a structured directory layout:

- **app**: Core application code.
bootstrap: Initialization and bootstrapping code.

- **config**: Configuration files.

- **database**: Migrations and seeders.

- **public**: Web server's root directory.

- **resources**: Views, assets, language files.

- **routes**: Define routes.

- **storage**: Application-generated files (logs, caches).
tests: PHPUnit tests.

- **vendor**: Composer dependencies.

## Development Workflow

### Routing

Define routes in the `routes/web.php` file:

```php
Route::get('/home', 'HomeController@index');
```

### Controllers

Create controllers for route handling:

```sh
php artisan make:controller HomeController
```

### Views

Use Blade templating for dynamic views:

```php
{{-- Blade Syntax --}}
@if(count($records) === 1)
    There is one record.
@else
    There are multiple records.
@endif
```

### Database

Migrate and seed the database:

```sh
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
```

### Eloquent ORM

Interact with the database using Eloquent models:

```php
$users = User::where('active', true)->get();
```

### Artisan Commands

Use Artisan commands to simplifiy tasks:

```sh
php artisan make:model ModelName
php artisan make:middleware MiddlewareName
```

## Deployment

### Configuration

Adjust environment and cofiguration settings:

- Set the`.env` file.
- Configure database and cache settings.

### Optimizations

- Enable caching (Redis, Memcached).
- Use a production-ready web server (Nginx, Apache).

### Security

- Keep dependencies updated.
- Use HTTPS for secure connections.
- Implement proper user authentication and authorization.

### Deployment Options

- Shared hosting: Use tools like Forge or deploy via SSH.

- Virtual Private Server (VPS): Set up server environment manually.

- Platform as a Service (PaaS): Use services like Heroku or Laravel Forge.

- Containers: Deploy using Docker and container orchestration tools.

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- Automate testing and deployment with tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitHub Actions.

### Scaling

- Use load balancers for distributing traffic.

- Optimize database queries for performance.

- Utilize caching mechanisms.
