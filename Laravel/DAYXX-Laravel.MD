# Laravel Introduction 08/xx/2023

## What is Laravel?
Laravel is an open-source PHP web framework known for its elegance and versatility. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, making web development efficient and enjoyable. Some key features include:

- **Eloquent ORM**: A powerful database query builder and ActiveRecord implementation.

- **Artisan CLI**: A command-line tool for automating common development tasks.

- **Blade Templating**: A clean and expressive template engine.

- **Routing**: Easily define routes and URLs for your application.

- **Middleware**: Add layers of functionality to HTTP requests.

- **Authentication**: Built-in user authentication and authorization systems.

- **Composer Integration**: Dependency management for libraries and packages.

- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing support with PHPUnit.

## Getting Started

### Installation

You can install Laravel Using Composer

   ```powershell
   composer global require laravel/installer
   laravel new project-name
   ```

### Folder Structure

Laravel follows a structured directory layout:

- **app**: Core application code.
bootstrap: Initialization and bootstrapping code.

- **config**: Configuration files.

- **database**: Migrations and seeders.

- **public**: Web server's root directory.

- **resources**: Views, assets, language files.

- **routes**: Define routes.

- **storage**: Application-generated files (logs, caches).
tests: PHPUnit tests.

- **vendor**: Composer dependencies.

## Development Workflow

### Routing

Define routes in the `routes/web.php` file:

```php
Route::get('/home', 'HomeController@index');
```

### Controllers

Create controllers for route handling:

```sh
php artisan make:controller HomeController
```

### Views

Use Blade templating for dynamic views:

```php
{{-- Blade Syntax --}}
@if(count($records) === 1)
    There is one record.
@else
    There are multiple records.
@endif
```

### Database

Migrate and seed the database:

```sh
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
```

### Eloquent ORM

Interact with the database using Eloquent models:

```php
$users = User::where('active', true)->get();
```

### Artisan Commands

Use Artisan commands to simplifiy tasks:

```sh
php artisan make:model ModelName
php artisan make:middleware MiddlewareName
```

---
## Deployment

### Configuration

Adjust environment and cofiguration settings:

- Set the`.env` file.
- Configure database and cache settings.

### Optimizations

- Enable caching (Redis, Memcached).
- Use a production-ready web server (Nginx, Apache).

### Security

- Keep dependencies updated.
- Use HTTPS for secure connections.
- Implement proper user authentication and authorization.

### Deployment Options

- Shared hosting: Use tools like Forge or deploy via SSH.

- Virtual Private Server (VPS): Set up server environment manually.

- Platform as a Service (PaaS): Use services like Heroku or Laravel Forge.

- Containers: Deploy using Docker and container orchestration tools.

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- Automate testing and deployment with tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitHub Actions.

### Scaling

- Use load balancers for distributing traffic.

- Optimize database queries for performance.

- Utilize caching mechanisms.

# Middleware in Laravel

Middleware in Laravel is a fundamental concept that plays a crucial role in handling HTTP requests and responses. It provides a way to filter and modify incoming requests before they reach the application's routes or to manipulate the outgoing responses before they are sent back to the client. Middleware acts as a bridge between the client and the application, enabling developers to implement cross-cutting concerns, security measures, and other application-specific logic.

## How Middleware Works

When a request is made to a Laravel application, it passes through a series of middleware layers before reaching the designated route handler. Each middleware layer can perform tasks such as authentication, authorization, logging, and more. If a middleware layer terminates the request/response cycle, it can prevent subsequent middleware from being executed, effectively controlling the flow of requests.

## Creating Middleware

To create a new middleware in Laravel, you can use the `php artisan make:middleware` command. This generates a new middleware class under the `app/Http/Middleware` directory. Middleware classes typically contain two methods: `handle` and `terminate`.

1. `handle`: This method is called when a request enters the middleware. It can perform actions on the request, such as modifying request data, validating inputs, or checking authentication. If needed, it can also pass the request to the next middleware layer using `$next($request)`.

2. `terminate`: This method is called after the response is sent to the client. It provides an opportunity to perform actions after the request has been fully processed, such as logging or cleanup.

## Registering Middleware

Middleware can be assigned globally to all routes, to specific route groups, or to individual routes. Middleware registration is typically done in the `app/Http/Kernel.php` file. In this file, you will find the `$middleware` array (for global middleware), the `$middlewareGroups` array (for middleware groups), and the `$routeMiddleware` array (for named middleware).

## Example Middleware Usage

Here's an example of how you might use middleware in Laravel:

1. **Creating Middleware**: Let's say you want to create a middleware named `CheckAdmin` to ensure that only administrators can access certain routes.

2. **Defining Middleware Logic**: In the `handle` method of the `CheckAdmin` middleware, you can check if the authenticated user is an administrator. If not, you can redirect them to a different route or return an unauthorized response.

3. **Registering Middleware**: You can register the `CheckAdmin` middleware in the `$routeMiddleware` array in the `Kernel.php` file.

4. **Applying Middleware**: Apply the middleware to specific routes or groups by using the `middleware` method in route definitions. For example:
   
   ```php
   Route::get('/admin/dashboard', 'AdminController@dashboard')->middleware('checkAdmin');
