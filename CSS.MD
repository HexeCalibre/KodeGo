## Types of CSS
### Inline CSS
- Uses the style attribute inside the HTML elements. (not recommended)
```html
<h1 style="color: blue">CSS Introduction</h1>
```
### Internal CSS
- Uses the <style> element inside the <head> of the HTML page.
 ```html
<head>
  <style type="text/css">
    h1 {
        color: green;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>CSS Introduction</h1>
</body>
```
### External CSS

 <head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
</head>
 ```
 #### CSS file
 ```css
body {
   font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;
