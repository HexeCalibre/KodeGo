## What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language used primarily for front-end web development. It enables interactive and dynamic elements on websites, making them more user-friendly and engaging. JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers and can also be used on the server-side through platforms like Node.js.

## Prerequisite
Before diving into JavaScript, it is beneficial to have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, as JavaScript often interacts with these technologies to manipulate web pages.

## How to use?

```html
<script src=""></script>
```

> üìù **Best practice:** to put inside at the end of the `<body>` tag.

HTML `<script>` Attribute

| Attribute | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `defer`   | The script will be executed after the HTML document has been fully parsed. Multiple scripts with the defer attribute will maintain their execution order.                       |
| `async`   | The script will be fetched asynchronously while continuing to parse the HTML document. The script will be executed immediately after it is downloaded, regardless of the order. |

### Variables

| Attribute | Description                                                                                           |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `var`     | The old way of declaring variables. It has a function scope and can lead to some unexpected behavior. |
| `let`     | Introduced in ES6, it has block scope and is preferred over var in modern JavaScript.                 |
| `const`   | Also introduced in ES6, it creates a constant whose value cannot be changed after initialization.     |

When to use `var`, `let`, or `const`?

> 1. Always declare variables
> 2. Always use `const` if the value should not be changed
> 3. Always use `const` if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)
> 4. Only use `let` if you can't use const
> 5. Only use `var` if you MUST support old browsers.

Note: Variables are containers for storing values.

| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| String    | Represents textual data, e.g., "Hello, World!".                        |
| Integer   | Represents whole numbers, e.g., 42.                                    |

### Comment
In JavaScript, comments can be added to provide explanatory notes within the code. Single-line comments start with //, while multi-line comments are enclosed between /* and */.
```javascript
// This is single line comment
/* This
is multiline comments
*/
```

#### Comment Guidelines

Comments in code serve as important explanatory notes and aid in understanding the codebase. Well-written comments can make the code more maintainable and help other developers comprehend the purpose and functionality of different code segments. Follow these guidelines to write effective and useful comments:

1. **Be Clear and Concise:** Write comments that are easy to understand and get straight to the point. Avoid unnecessary elaboration or ambiguity.

2. **Explain Intent:** Describe the purpose and intention of the code. Why is the code doing what it does? This helps others understand the rationale behind specific decisions.

3. **Avoid Obvious Comments:** Avoid commenting on self-explanatory code. Comments should add value by providing insights that are not apparent from the code itself.

4. **Use Proper Grammar and Spelling:** Keep comments grammatically correct and spell-checked. Poorly written comments can be confusing and unprofessional.

5. **Update Comments with Code Changes:** Ensure that comments are updated whenever the corresponding code changes. Outdated comments can lead to confusion.

6. **Keep Comments Updated and Relevant:** As the code evolves, make sure to review and update comments to reflect the current state of the codebase.

7. **Use Meaningful Variable Names:** Instead of explaining variables in comments, use descriptive names that convey their purpose.

8. **Comment Complex Logic:** Comment complex algorithms or logic to make it easier for others to grasp the reasoning behind the implementation.

9. **Avoid Commenting Trivial Steps:** Only comment when necessary. Trivial steps may clutter the code unnecessarily.

10. **Consider Future Readers:** Write comments as if you are explaining the code to someone who is not familiar with it.

11. **Use Proper Comment Formats:** Depending on the programming language, follow appropriate comment formats (e.g., `//` for single-line comments, `/* */` for multi-line comments).

12. **Avoid Leaving Debug Comments:** Remove or comment out debug statements before committing the code.

13. **Comment on Non-Obvious Workarounds:** If the code includes workarounds or non-standard solutions, explain the reasoning behind them.

14. **Group Related Code Blocks:** Commenting can help group and organize related sections of code.

15. **Be Respectful and Professional:** Avoid negative or offensive language in comments. Maintain a professional tone.

Remember, comments are for humans, not the computer. They should provide valuable insights, simplify understanding, and make collaboration easier for everyone involved in the project.

### String Manipulation

1. Old Style Concatination
```javascript
var firstName = "John";
var lastName = "Doe";
var fullName = firstName + " " + lastName; 
// Result: "John Doe"
```
Old-style concatenation involves using the + operator to join strings together. It was the traditional way to build strings in older versions of JavaScript.

Use old-style concatenation when:

You are working with older JavaScript environments that do not support string interpolation (e.g., ES5 or below).
You are building strings using variables that are not supported inside template literals (backticks).


2. String Interpolation
```javascript
var firstName = "John";
var lastName = "Doe";
var fullName = `${firstName} ${lastName}`; 
// Result: "John Doe"
```

String interpolation was introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) using backticks (```). It allows embedding expressions (variables, functions, etc.) directly within the string using ${...} placeholders.

Use string interpolation when:

You are working with modern JavaScript environments (ES6 and above).
You want to make the code more readable and maintainable by avoiding the need for complex concatenation.
You have multiple variables or expressions to include within the string, making the code cleaner and easier to understand.
String interpolation is generally preferred over old-style concatenation because it offers cleaner syntax and makes the code more expressive. However, if you are dealing with older JavaScript environments or need to concatenate strings with complex expressions, old-style concatenation might be the only viable option. In modern JavaScript projects, string interpolation is the recommended approach for string manipulation.

### String method

| Method                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `length`                                | Returns the length (number of characters) of a string.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `charAt(index)`                         | Returns the character at the specified index in the string.                                                                                                                                                             |
| `indexOf(searchValue[, fromIndex])`     | Returns the index of the first occurrence of searchValue in the string, starting from the optional fromIndex. If not found, it returns -1.                                                                              |
| `lastIndexOf(searchValue[, fromIndex])` | Returns the index of the last occurrence of searchValue in the string, starting from the optional fromIndex. If not found, it returns -1.                                                                               |
| `slice(start[, end])`                   | Extracts a portion of the string starting from start index to end index (exclusive). If end is omitted, it extracts until the end of the string. Negative indices can also be used to count from the end of the string. |
| `concat(str1, str2, ..., strN)`         | Concatenates one or more strings with the original string and returns the resulting string.                                                                                                                             |
| `replace(searchValue, replaceValue)`    | Replaces occurrences of searchValue with replaceValue in the string. Only the first occurrence is replaced unless using a regular expression with the g flag.                                                           |
| `replaceAll()`                          | Replaces all occurrences of searchValue with replaceValue in the string. This method was introduced in ECMAScript 2021 (ES12).                                                                                          |
| `toLowerCase)`                          | Converts all characters in the string to lowercase.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `toUpperCase)`                          | Converts all characters in the string to uppercase.                                                                                                                                                                     |

### Arrays
An array is a fundamental data structure in JavaScript used to store a collection of elements. It allows you to organize and work with multiple values in a single variable. Arrays in JavaScript can hold a mix of data types, including numbers, strings, objects, and even other arrays. They are versatile and widely used in JavaScript programming. Here's how you define and work with arrays:

1. Array Creation:
   
You can create an array using square brackets [] and adding elements separated by commas:
```javascript
// Creating an array with numbers
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Creating an array with strings
const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];

// Creating an array with a mix of data types
const mixedArray = [1, 'hello', true, { key: 'value' }];
```

2. Accessing Array Elements:

You can access individual elements of an array using their index. The index starts at 0 for the first element, 1 for the second, and so on:
```javascript
const numbers = [10, 20, 30];

console.log(numbers[0]); // Output: 10
console.log(numbers[1]); // Output: 20
console.log(numbers[2]); // Output: 30

```

3. Modifying Array Elements:
   
You can modify array elements by assigning new values to the specific index:
```javascript
let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];

fruits[1] = 'grape';
console.log(fruits); // Output: ['apple', 'grape', 'orange']
```
4. Array Methods:
   
Arrays come with various built-in methods that allow you to manipulate their contents:

- `join(separator)`
The `join()` method converts all the elements of an array into a string and concatenates them using the specified `separator`. It returns the resulting string. The `separator` is optional, and if not provided, the elements are concatenated with a comma as the default separator.

```javascript
const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];

const joinedString = fruits.join(', ');
console.log(joinedString); // Output: "apple, banana, orange"
```
- `splice(start, deleteCount, item1, item2, ...)`
  
The `splice()` method allows you to modify an array by adding or removing elements. It takes three parameters:

- `start`: The index at which to start changing the array.
- `deleteCount`: The number of elements to remove starting from the start index. If set to 0, no elements are removed.
- `item1, item2, ...`: Elements to add to the array starting from the start index.
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Removing elements from the array (deleteCount > 0)
numbers.splice(2, 2); // Removes 3 and 4
console.log(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 5]

// Adding elements to the array (deleteCount = 0)
numbers.splice(2, 0, 3, 4); // Inserts 3 and 4 at index 2
console.log(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
- `split(separator[, limit])`
  
The `split()` method splits a string into an array of substrings based on the specified `separator`. The resulting array elements will be the parts of the original string separated by the `separator`. The `limit` parameter is optional and represents the maximum number of splits to be performed.
```javascript
const sentence = 'Hello, how are you?';

const words = sentence.split(' '); // Split by space
console.log(words); // Output: ['Hello,', 'how', 'are', 'you?']

const letters = sentence.split(''); // Split by each character
console.log(letters); // Output: ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ',', ' ', 'h', 'o', 'w', ' ', 'a', 'r', 'e', ' ', 'y', 'o', 'u', '?']
```
- `reverse()`
  
The `reverse()` method reverses the order of elements in an array, modifying the original array.
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

numbers.reverse();
console.log(numbers); // Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```
- `shift()`
  
The `shift()` method removes the first element from the array and returns that removed element. The length of the array is decreased by 1.

```javascript
const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];

const firstFruit = fruits.shift();
console.log(firstFruit); // Output: "apple"
console.log(fruits); // Output: ["banana", "orange"]
```
- `unshift(item1, item2, ...)`
  
The `unshift()` method adds one or more elements to the beginning of the array and returns the new length of the array.

```javascript
const numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5];

const newLength = numbers.unshift(1);
console.log(newLength); // Output: 5 (new length of the
```

- `push(element1, element2, ...)`
  
The `push()` method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array. It modifies the original array by adding the elements provided as arguments to the end of the array.
```javascript
const fruits = ['apple', 'banana'];

const newLength = fruits.push('orange', 'grape');
console.log(newLength); // Output: 4 (new length of the array)
console.log(fruits); // Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape']
```
In this example, the `push()` method adds two elements, `'orange'` and `'grape'`, to the end of the fruits array, and the array becomes `['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape']`. The `push()` method returns the new length of the array, which in this case is `4`.

- `pop()`
  
The `pop()` method removes the last element from an array and returns that element. It modifies the original array by removing the last element.
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const removedElement = numbers.pop();
console.log(removedElement); // Output: 5 (removed element)
console.log(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
In this example, the `pop()` method removes the last element `5` from the numbers array, and the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The method also returns the removed element, which in this case is `5`.

- `slice(start, end)`
  
The `slice()` method extracts a section of an array and returns a new array containing the extracted elements. It takes two parameters:

- `start`: The index at which to start the extraction. If `start` is negative, it counts from the end of the array.
- `end`: The index before which to end the extraction. If `end` is negative, it counts from the end of the array. If end is omitted, the slice includes all elements from `start` to the end of the array.

```javascript
const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape', 'kiwi'];

const slicedFruits = fruits.slice(1, 4);
console.log(slicedFruits); // Output: ['banana', 'orange', 'grape']
```
In this example, the `slice(1, 4)` method extracts elements from index `1` (inclusive) to index `4` (exclusive), creating a new array `['banana', 'orange', 'grape']` from the `fruits` array. The original `fruits` array remains unchanged.

The addition of these explanations completes the overview of the `push`, `pop`, and `slice` array methods. These methods are widely used for adding, removing, and extracting elements from arrays in JavaScript.

> These are just a few examples of array methods; there are many more available for sorting, filtering, mapping, and more. Arrays provide a powerful way to work with collections of data in JavaScript.

### Operators
In JavaScript, operators are symbols or keywords that perform various operations on values or variables. They allow you to manipulate data, perform mathematical calculations, make comparisons, and control program flow. Here are some of the most commonly used operators in JavaScript:

- Arithmetic Operators
  
  Arithmetic operators perform mathematical calculations:
```javascript
let a = 5;
let b = 2;

a + b; // Addition: 7
a - b; // Subtraction: 3
a * b; // Multiplication: 10
a / b; // Division: 2.5
a % b; // Modulus (remainder of division): 1
a ** b; // Exponentiation: 25
```
- Relational Operators

  Relational operators compare two values and return a boolean result:
```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = 10;

x == y; // Equal to: false
x != y; // Not equal to: true
x === "5"; // Strict equal to: false (value and type must be the same)
x !== "5"; // Strict not equal to: true (value or type is different)
x > y; // Greater than: false
x < y; // Less than: true
x >= 5; // Greater than or equal to: true
y <= 10; // Less than or equal to: true
```
- Logical Operators

  Logical operators perform logical operations and return a boolean value:
```javascript
let p = true;
let q = false;

p && q; // Logical AND: false
p || q; // Logical OR: true
!p; // Logical NOT: false
!q; // Logical NOT: true
```
- Assignment Operators

Assignment operators assign values to variables:
```javascript
let num = 5;

num += 2; // Addition assignment: num is now 7
num -= 3; // Subtraction assignment: num is now 4
num *= 2; // Multiplication assignment: num is now 8
num /= 4; // Division assignment: num is now 2
num %= 2; // Modulus assignment: num is now 0
```
- Increment and Decrement Operators
  Increment and decrement operators change the value of a variable by 1:
```javascript
let counter = 0;

counter++; // Increment: counter is now 1
counter--; // Decrement: counter is now 0
```
- Bitwise Operators
```javascript
let a = 5; // Binary representation: 00000000000000000000000000000101
let b = 3; // Binary representation: 00000000000000000000000000000011

a & b; // Bitwise AND: 00000000000000000000000000000001 (1 in decimal)
a | b; // Bitwise OR: 00000000000000000000000000000111 (7 in decimal)
a ^ b; // Bitwise XOR: 00000000000000000000000000000110 (6 in decimal)
~a; // Bitwise NOT: 11111111111111111111111111111010 (-6 in decimal)
a << 1; // Left shift by 1: 00000000000000000000000000001010 (10 in decimal)
a >> 1; // Right shift by 1: 00000000000000000000000000000010 (2 in decimal)
a >>> 1; // Zero-fill right shift by 1: 00000000000000000000000000000010 (2 in decimal)
```
These operators are essential for writing powerful and expressive JavaScript code. They provide the foundation for performing various operations and implementing complex logic in your programs.

A conditional statement, also known as a conditional expression or conditional construct, is a programming concept that allows you to make decisions in your code based on certain conditions. It enables you to execute different blocks of code or take specific actions depending on whether a condition evaluates to true or false.

In JavaScript, there are several ways to implement conditional statements:

- `if` Statement:
  
  The `if` statement is the simplest conditional statement. It executes a block of code only if the specified condition is true.
  
```javascript
let num = 10;

if (num > 0) {
console.log("The number is positive.");
```

- `if-else` Statement:
  
  The `if-else` statement allows you to execute one block of code if the condition is true, and another block of code if the condition is false.

```javascript
let num = -5;

if (num > 0) {
  console.log("The number is positive.");
} else {
  console.log("The number is non-positive.");
}
```

- `if-else if-else` Statement:
  
  The `if-else if-else` statement allows you to test multiple conditions and execute different blocks of code based on which condition is true first.

```javascript
let num = 0;

if (num > 0) {
  console.log("The number is positive.");
} else if (num < 0) {
  console.log("The number is negative.");
} else {
  console.log("The number is zero.");
}
```

- `switch` Statement:

   The `switch` statement provides an alternative way to handle multiple conditions based on the value of an expression.

```javascript
let day = "Monday";

switch (day) {
  case "Monday":
    console.log("It's the start of the week.");
    break;
  case "Friday":
    console.log("It's the end of the week.");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("It's a regular day.");
    break;
}
```
Conditional statements are essential for implementing logic and making your programs responsive to different situations. They allow you to control the flow of execution and ensure that your code behaves as expected in various scenarios.

### Primitive Literals

In JavaScript, primitive literals allow us to represent fixed values of the five primitive data types directly in our code. These literals provide a convenient way to define and work with simple data without the need for explicit constructor functions. Here are the five types of primitive literals in JavaScript:

#### 1. String Literal

String literals are used to represent textual data and are enclosed in either single or double quotes.

Example:

```javascript
const name = "John";
const message = 'Hello, world!';
```
#### 2. Numeric Literal
Numeric literal can be written as integers (`int`) or floating point numbers(`float`).
Numeric literals are used to represent numbers, including integers and floating-point numbers.

Example:
```javascript
const age = 30;
const pi = 3.14159;
```
#### 3. Boolean Literal
Boolean values are represented by keywords such as true/false that have no value associated with them like.
Boolean literals represent Boolean values, which can be either `true` or `false`.

Example :
```javascript
const isLogged = true;
const hasPermission = false;
```
#### 4. Undefined Literal
The undefined keyword represents an unknown variable state where it doesn't hold any value at all. It
is often used when we want to declare variables but not assign anything yet. The undefined literal represents the primitive value undefined, indicating the absence of a value.

Example:
```javascript
let value; // value is undefined
```
#### 5. Null Literal
Null is the only primitive type that does not contain any value. The null keyword represents this empty
state of variables holding nothingness. The null literal represents the primitive value `null`, often used to indicate the intentional absence of a value.

Example:
```javascript
const user = null; //No user data available
```
>Understanding primitive literals is essential for working with JavaScript's basic data types and creating simple data structures in your code. These literals serve as the foundation for more complex data structures and objects in the language.

### Loops
Loops in JavaScript allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. They are essential for performing repetitive tasks efficiently. JavaScript supports several types of loops:

1. `for` Loop

The `for` loop is one of the most commonly used loops in JavaScript. It allows you to execute a block of code for a specific number of iterations.
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```
2. `while` Loop

The `while` loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
```javascript
let count = 0;

while (count < 5) {
  console.log(count);
  count++;
}
```
3. `do-while` Loop

The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it executes the block of code at least once before checking the condition.

```javascript
let number = 1;

do {
  console.log(number);
  number++;
} while (number <= 5);
```

4. `for-in` Loop

The `for-in` loop is used to iterate over the properties of an object.
```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  occupation: 'Engineer',
};

for (const key in person) {
  console.log(key + ': ' + person[key]);
}
```
5. `for-of` Loop

The `for-of` loop is introduced in ES6 and is used to iterate over iterable objects like arrays and strings.
```javascript
const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];

for (const color of colors) {
  console.log(color);
}
```
6. Looping Through Arrays
   
   Looping through arrays is a common use case for many programming tasks. Here's an example of how you can do it in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Sample array
const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Using for loop to iterate through the array
console.log("Using for loop:");
for (let i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {
  console.log(myArray[i]);
}

// Using for...of loop to iterate through the array
console.log("Using for...of loop:");
for (const element of myArray) {
  console.log(element);
}

// Using while loop to iterate through the array
console.log("Using while loop:");
let j = 0;
while (j < myArray.length) {
  console.log(myArray[j]);
  j++;
}

// Using do...while loop to iterate through the array
console.log("Using do...while loop:");
let k = 0;
do {
  console.log(myArray[k]);
  k++;
} while (k < myArray.length);
```
>In this example, we have an array `myArray` containing some numbers. We then use different types of loops to iterate over the elements of the array and print them to the console. You can perform any desired operations on the array elements within the loop's body.
>
>Loops are powerful tools for automating repetitive tasks and processing large amounts of data. However, be cautious about using infinite loops that might cause your program to hang or crash. Always ensure that your loop has a proper exit condition to prevent unintended behavior.

### Loop Choices and Use Cases

#### `for` Loop:

- Use when you know the exact number of iterations you need to perform.
- Ideal for looping over a numerical range or a fixed number of times.

#### `while` Loop:

- Use when you want to repeat a block of code based on a condition that might change during the loop.
- Appropriate when the number of iterations is uncertain.

#### `do-while` Loop:

- Similar to the while loop, but the block of code is executed at least once before checking the condition.
- Useful when you want to ensure that the loop runs at least once, regardless of the condition.

#### `for-in` Loop:

- Use when you want to loop through the enumerable properties of an object.
- Suitable for iterating over object properties and performing operations based on each property.

#### `for-of` Loop:

- Introduced in ES6, use when you want to iterate over elements of an iterable object, like arrays or strings.
- Convenient for working with arrays or collections of data.
### Common Scenarios and Loop Usage:

- Use a `for` loop when you know the number of iterations in advance or when you need to loop through an index-based collection.
- Use a `while` loop when you don't know the number of iterations in advance and need to loop based on a specific condition.
- Use a `do-while` loop when you want to execute a block of code at least once before checking the condition.
- Use a `for-in` loop when you want to iterate over the properties of an object.
- Use a `for-of` loop when you want to iterate over elements of an iterable object like an array or a string.

>Keep in mind that improper use of loops or using the wrong loop type can lead to unintended consequences, such as infinite loops or inefficient code. Always choose the loop that best fits the specific requirements of your task and make sure to have proper exit conditions to prevent infinite loops.

### Functions
Functions in programming are reusable blocks of code that can be called and executed to perform a specific task or return a value. They allow you to break down your code into smaller, manageable pieces, promoting code organization, modularity, and reusability.

In most programming languages, functions have the following components:

1. Function Declaration/Definition: This is where you create the function and specify its name, parameters (if any), and return type (if any). The function name is used to call the function later in your code.

2. Parameters: Parameters (also known as arguments) are values that you can pass into the function when you call it. Functions can accept zero or more parameters, which act as inputs to the function's logic.

3. Function Body: The function body contains the actual code that gets executed when the function is called. It defines the actions or calculations that the function performs.

4. Return Statement: If a function is expected to produce a result, you can use the `return` statement to send that result back to the code that called the function.

Here's a simple example of a function in JavaScript:
```javascript
// Function declaration with parameters
function addNumbers(a, b) {
  const sum = a + b;
  return sum; // Return the result
}

// Function call with arguments
const result = addNumbers(5, 10);
console.log(result); // Output: 15
```
In this example, we defined a function called `addNumbers` that takes two parameters (`a` and `b`) and returns their sum. When we call the function with `addNumbers(5, 10)`, it returns the result `15`, which is then stored in the variable `result` and printed to the console.

Functions are essential building blocks in programming, as they help modularize code and promote code reusability. They are widely used to encapsulate logic and provide a clear interface for interacting with various parts of the codebase.

#### Types of Function

1. **Named Functions**: These are traditional functions that have a specific name. They can be defined using the `function` keyword in JavaScript or similar constructs in other programming languages.
```javascript
function addNumbers(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

2. **Anonymous Functions**: These functions do not have a specific name and are often defined using function expressions. They are usually assigned to variables and can be used as callbacks or immediately invoked.
   
```javascript
const myFunction = function (name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
};
```
3. **Arrow Functions**: Arrow functions are a concise syntax for writing functions in JavaScript. They have a shorter syntax and do not bind their own `this` value.

```javascript
const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;
```
4. **Higher-Order Functions**: These are functions that take one or more functions as arguments or return a function as their result.

```javascript
function executeOperation(operation, a, b) {
  return operation(a, b);
}

const result = executeOperation((x, y) => x + y, 5, 10); // Result will be 15
```

5. **Recursive Functions**: These functions call themselves within their own definition. They are often used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems.

```javascript
function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 0) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
}
```

6. **Generator Functions**: Generator functions are special functions that can pause their execution and resume it later. They use the yield keyword to `yield` values one at a time.
  
```javascript
function* generateSequence() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}

const sequence = generateSequence();
console.log(sequence.next().value); // Output: 1
console.log(sequence.next().value); // Output: 2
console.log(sequence.next().value); // Output: 3
```
